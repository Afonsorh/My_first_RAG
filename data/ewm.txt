4.2 Basic Warehouse Inbound
Processing from Supplier: 1FS
In this section, we will first introduce the complex goods receipt
process of the SAP Best Practices, in which the functions of the
transport control and the RF-based processing of handling units in
the processing of incoming goods are in the foreground. Second, we
will explore the following variants through custom developments and
enhancements:
1FSa: Automatic handling unit creation without packaging
specifications
You will get familiar with the BAdI for automatic handling unit
creation.
1FSb: Simplify the screen flow for RF putaway
We will adjust the RF framework Customizing to skip the entry
screen of the RF putaway transaction.
With most enhancements that we introduce in this section, you will
find the BREAK-POINT ID ABAP statement in the coding. For each
enhancement, we use a corresponding checkpoint group. You can
create and activate the checkpoint groups using Transaction SAAB
(Checkpoints that Can Be Activated).
4.2.1 Process Description of Scope Item 1FS
In Table 4.3, you will find in an overview of the steps for scope item
1FS (Basic Warehouse Inbound Processing from Supplier). We list
the physical activities and the system activities in separate columns.
The process steps in SAP S/4HANA modules are skipped, and we
start with the description of the EWM steps. A purchase order was
created in materials management in SAP S/4HANA as preparation.
Steps 3, 5, and 8 are completed by a goods receipt office clerk with
system access via a desktop or a tablet PC using either SAP GUI or
SAP Fiori–based apps. The warehouse operators who are physically
moving the pallets from the truck (step 2), packing at the packing
station (step 4) and moving to the final bin (step 7) work with mobile
RF guns so that they post the movements in the system as they
occur using RF based apps.
During the putaway operation, there are a couple of variants to be
found in the scope item. These variants are based on different
products requiring different packaging, storage concepts, and final
destination storage types. They include piece- or carton-based small
part rack storage in a mezzanine, pallet-based narrow aisle high rack
storage (including handover locations for the narrow aisle truck) for
medium size parts, and ground floor–based bulk storage (mainly full
pallets stacked in front and on top of each other) for large parts,
allowing for either full pallet or partial pallet putaway. Another
process variant includes clarification and repacking of small parts
that arrived in the wrong packaging.

4.2.2 Enhancement 1FSa: Automatic Handling
Unit Creation without Packaging Specifications
In custom development 1FSa, we will enhance the inbound steps
with a function called Automatic Handling Unit Creation without
Packaging Specifications. Step 3 of standard scope item 1FS will
change with this custom development, making step 4 obsolete (see
Table 4.4). All other process steps stay the same as described in
Table 4.3.
[»] Consider Unified Package Builder Functionality
EWM offers a rather new feature that allows you to activate data
sources other than the packaging specification for packaging
requirements or proposals. These include SAP S/4HANA–based
packing instructions and SAP Supply Chain Management–based
package builder rules (e.g., alternative units of measure from the
global material data).

3: Create EWM inbound
delivery (EWM) via GUI
Transaction /SCWM/PRDI
and create handling units.
N/A The warehouse clerk
checks the quantities,
creates handling units in
the system, and prints the
new handling unit labels.
She then posts the goods
receipt.
Table 4.4
Process Steps with Deviation for Enhancement 1FSa
The main difference between scope item 1FS and enhancement
1FSa is that the pallets arriving from the office clerk create the
handling unit labels instead of the warehouse operator, while the
latter will apply them on the shop floor. The handling unit label will
stay with the pallet as long as possible and can, for example, be
used for an internal move, replenishment, or stock removal.
In standard EWM, you could let the system automatically create
handling units in the inbound process based on packaging
specifications or unified package builder profiles. So for each product
(or reference product), you have to maintain a packaging
specification that defines the pallet quantity, the handling unit type,
and the packaging material for the pallet. If you do not have
packaging specifications for each product, and the unified package
builder might not be an option, the solution shown in this chapter
might be a suitable alternative in your project.
To realize enhancement 1FSa, the following steps are necessary:
1. Create a new master data table ZHU_PMAT to determine the
packaging material for the handling units.
2. Implement the HU_PROPOSAL method of BAdI
/SCWM/EX_HU_BASICS_AUTOPACK.
3. Switch on automatic packing for the inbound delivery.
4. Create a condition record to print handling unit labels.
Deactivate the printing for warehouse order labels.
We describe the details for these four steps in the following sections.
First, however, let’s look at the pallet building process in 1FS and
discuss the prerequisites for this enhancement. We’ll also close the
section by discussing how to test process 1FSa.
Pallet Building in Process 1FS
Process 1FS uses the quantity classification based on alternative
UOM to determine the warehouse task quantity when putting away
product from the clarification area. The alternative UOMs are defined
in the product (see Figure 4.3), so, for example, 192 EA is one pallet,
and 8 EA is one carton.
Figure 4.3
Material Master with UOM: Additional Data
In the EWM · Master Data · Product · Define Unit of Measure
Attributes IMG activity, the UOMs are assigned to quantity
classifications (see Figure 4.4). So, for example, Quantity
Classification P (Pallets) is assigned to Unit PAL. Based on this
setting, the system will split the warehouse task quantities during
warehouse task task creation in put-away and could also determine
different storage types for putaway.
Figure 4.4
IMG Activity to Assign Quantity Classification to Units
So if, for example, an inbound delivery with a quantity of 400 EA is
received in the warehouse, the system would create four product
warehouse tasks (see Figure 4.5, where we simulate inbound
delivery packing in Transaction /SCWM/PRDI):
Two warehouse tasks with 192 EA = 1 PAL
Two warehouse tasks with 8 EA = 1 CAR
Figure 4.5
Automatic Handling Unit Creation in Inbound Delivery Packing
Prerequisites for Enhancement 1FSa
Enhancement 1FSa is useful in a warehouse if these prerequisites
are met:
No packaging specifications by product exist.
The unified package builder is not a valid option.
The pallet and/or carton quantity is available as an alternative
UOM by product.
Create New Master Data Table
To create a handling unit in the system, a packaging material is
mandatory. The system takes over the tare weight, volume, and
handling unit type from the packing material master and also the kind
of numbering (e.g., number range, Serial Shipping Container Code
[SSCC]) specified via the packaging material. Hence, we will use a
new, simple master data table to determine the packaging material
based on the quantity classification. We will also determine a
handling unit type that could be used to influence the putaway
strategy and to find the optimal bin type.
Create a new database in ABAP Dictionary (Transaction SE11).
Enter the name, such as ZHU_PMAT, and a description. In Delivery
Class, choose option A (master and transactional data), and in the
Data Browser/Table View Maintenance field, make sure you
choose option X—Display/Maintenance Allowed. On the Fields
tab, maintain the fields as they are listed in Table 4.5.
Field Data Element Key Check Table/Search Help
CLIENT MANDT Yes
LGNUM /SCWM/LGNUM Yes /SCWM/SH_LGNUM
QUANCLA /SCWM/DE_QUANCLA Yes /SCWM/TQUANCLA

PACKMAT /SCWM/DE_PMAT No /SCWM/SH_PMAT_ONLY
Table 4.5
Fields of Custom Table ZHU_PMAT
For the technical settings of the new table, choose “APPL0” for Data
Class ,“0” for Size Category, and switch on the buffering (fully
buffered).
After you have saved and activated the table, navigate to the table
maintenance generator (Transaction SE55) and generate a
maintenance view (e.g., with authorization group SCEA and function
group ZHU_PMAT).
Last but not least, maintain a few entries in the new table using
Transaction SM31 (Maintain Table Views; see Figure 4.6).
Figure 4.6
Maintain Packaging Material and Handling Unit Type in Table
ZHU_PMAT
Implement the HU_PROPOSAL Method
To implement method HU_PROPOSAL, you have to start the BAdI
Builder (Transaction SE19) and create an implementation for
enhancement spot /SCWM/ES_HU_BASICS. First enter the name of the
enhancement implementation (e.g., ZEI_HU_BASICS) and then choose
BAdI definition /SCWM/EX_HU_BASICS_AUTOPACK. As a name for the
BAdI implementation, you can enter, for example,
ZEX_HU_BASICS_AUTOPACK, and as a class name, choose
ZCL_IM_HU_BASICS_AUTOPACK. Navigate to the HU_PROPOSAL method and
enter the coding as shown in Listing 4.1. Define one static, private
attribute, ST_TUOM_QCLA, of type /SCWM/TT_UOM_QCLA for the class.
Activate the coding and also the BAdI implementation:
In coding paragraph “1, we first fetch the quantity classification
table (/SCWM/TUOM_QCLA) from the IMG.
We loop over all delivery items, and for each product we
determine the list of alternative UOMs (see paragraph “2).
By using standard function module /SCWM/QUANCLA_DET_UOM, we
determine the quantity classification depending on the unpacked,
open quantity (see “3).
Based on the quantity classification, we determine in our new
table ZHU_PMAT the packaging material and handling unit type (see
“4).
To determine the handling unit target quantity, we look up the first
alternative unit that matches the required quantity classification.
The numerator of this unit becomes the target quantity (see
paragraph “5).
In the last two paragraphs, “6 and “7, we finally create a handling
unit and pack the delivery item into it.
Note that we do not use the save method or the commit statement.
As this is a BAdI implementation, we expect the calling
environment to take care of saving and database commits.

No Automatic Packing: Yes
With this setting, we switch off the automatic packing during
inbound delivery creation. As in our process variant, we first want
the user to verify the quantity and then create the handling unit
labels in the office. We want the user to start the automatic
packing manually when he is done with checking.
Create a Condition Record
As we want the system to print the labels automatically when the
user creates the handling units, check and create new condition
records in SAP menu EWM · Work Scheduling · Print · Settings ·
Create Condition Records for Printing (HUs). Enter application
and maintenance group PHU and select existing condition records
for condition type 0HU1. Check the results list. If one does not exist

After the user saves the results of automatic packing, the system will
automatically print the handling unit labels, shown in Figure 4.8. The
standard form shows a barcode, but it is very likely that you will have
to adjust this form to your printer size and your barcode type.
Figure 4.8
Printout of Handling Unit Content Label
For the putaway step 4 of the test case, you have now two options:
either execute the step as described in the standard process, or
continue with the information in the next section to use enhancement
1FSb.

4.2.3 Enhancement 1FSb: Simplify the Screen
Flow for Radio Frequency Putaway
In enhancement 1FSb, we will change step 7, Put Away the Goods,
of process 1FS. The changes are described in Table 4.7. In the
standard process, the putaway is paper-driven and without RF
support. The warehouse operators move the pallets to the final bins
and hand over the papers to the office clerk. Several times per day,
the office clerk confirms the warehouse orders in the system based
on the returned papers. This way, the stock increases and becomes
available for sale. In process variant 1FSb, the warehouse operators
will use RF devices and confirm each move of stock in the system
immediately.
In this section, we give an instruction on how to simplify the Putaway
by Warehouse Order RF transaction (logical RF Transaction
PTWOSI). With an adjustment in the RF framework, we reduce the
number of UIs and eliminate one RF screen. So for each pallet the
user scans, there is a warehouse order barcode from the paper and
the destination bin barcode.

Table 4.7
Process Steps with Deviation for Enhancement 1FSb
To realize the variant 1FSb, Simplify the Screen Flow for RF
Putaway, you have to do the following steps:
1. Create RF presentation profile 1710 and copy the standard
menu.
2. Change the RF step flow for logical Transaction PTWOSI and
presentation profile 1710 such that the first screen is skipped.
The details for these two steps are described in the following
sections. As usual, we will begin by discussing the prerequisites and
end by discussing testing of this enhancement.
Prerequisites for Enhancement 1FSb
Enhancement 1FSb has the following prerequisites:
Wi-Fi and mobile devices are supported in the warehouse
Warehouse order barcode is on the printout of the warehouse
order
Create the Presentation Profile
Now create a new presentation profile (see also Chapter 3,
Section 3.3) to make warehouse-specific changes in the RF
framework Customizing in the next step:
Create a new presentation and personalization profile. This is
done in the EWM · Mobile Data Entry · Define Steps in Logical
Transactions IMG activity. In the Define Presentation Profiles
folder, create a new entry, “1710”, by copying the existing ****
entry.
In the RF Menu Manager IMG activity, keep the default values on
the entry screen and use the Copy Menu function. In the popup,
enter presentation profile 1710, then continue and save.
Assign the new presentation profile 1710 to warehouse number
1710. This is done in IMG activity Assign Presentation Profile to
Warehouse.
Change the RF Step Flow
We now change one entry in the RF framework Customizing so that
the system will skip the putaway source screen.
Go to IMG activity EWM · Mobile Data Entry · Define Steps in
Logical Transactions. In the Define Logical Transactions folder,
select logical Transaction PTWO** and navigate to subfolder Define
Logical Transaction Step Flow. Select and copy the entry with the
following keys:
Presentation profile: ****
Logical transaction: PTWO**
Step: PTHUSC
Function code: PBO1
Before you save, change the following fields:
Presentation profile: 1710
Next step: PTHUDS
Processing mode: 1—Background
Function code background: PBO1
With the changed settings, the system will skip the screen for step
PTHUSC and immediately continue with step PTHUDS.
[»] Copy Instead of Change
We recommend not changing settings for presentation profile ****.
For each project/template project, create a separate presentation
profile as shown in step 3 and copy the standard settings from
profile **** to your own profile before changing them. You can then
use the unchanged settings for profile **** as reference. If there is
a problem in RF, you can change back to **** before you ask SAP
Support for help.
Testing of Enhancement 1FSb

Expected result:

Table 4.8
Test Steps for Enhancement 1FSb
In Figure 4.9, we want to show you how the RF transaction works for
standard presentation profile ****, as follows:
In the RF menu, the user chooses 03 Putaway by WO.
Figure 4.9
Putaway by Warehouse Order with Presentation Profile ****
On the entry screen, the user scans the barcode for the warehouse
order (RF step PTWOSL).
On the source screen (RF step PTHUSC), the user confirms the
pickup of the stock with several presses of (Enter).
On the destination screen (RF step PTHUDS), the user scans the
destination bin after he puts the stock there.
When using the new presentation profile 1710, you’ll see that step
PTHUSC is skipped by the system. The flow of screens is shown in
Figure 4.10. So for each putaway transaction, the user will save one
screen and one (Enter) press. There is also a difference in the
number of warehouse tasks: the system will not use two tasks (one
for posting stock from the source bin to the resource and another for
posting stock from the resource to the destination bin). It will post
only one task—that is, the moment the user confirms the destination
bin.
Figure 4.10
Putaway by Warehouse Order with Presentation Profile 1710
To have only one instead of two warehouse tasks at the end of the
transaction is also a benefit in case the user changes his mind and
steps back with (F7) on the destination screen (step PTHUDS). With
the standard settings, the stock would stay on the resource and
hence no other resource would be able to perform this warehouse
order. If you work with high-level forklifts and low-level forklifts, it can
happen quite often that only after seeing the destination screen can
the operator decide if he is capable of doing the putaway at that
destination bin.
In this section, you learned how to skip screens in RF and how to
process steps in background mode without coding adjustments.
There are more RF transactions in the standard where you might
have the need to skip a screen if the screen does not provide
valuable information to your users.
